# 🌟 Gamified Personal Productivity System

This is a **gamified productivity system** designed to turn everyday tasks and goals into a fun, rewarding journey focused on personal growth.

---

## 🎯 Concept

The system encourages users to **grow and thrive in real life** by completing tasks and objectives. Each completed task grants:

- **Experience Points (XP)**: boost your personal attributes.
- **Prosperity Points**: accumulate and can be spent in the **Prosperity Shop**, where you reward yourself for your efforts (e.g., a new pair of shoes, an ice cream, or anything else you feel you deserve).

---

## ⚔️ Task Difficulty

Each task can be marked as:

- **Easy**
- **Medium**
- **Hard**
- **Custom** (defined by the user)

The higher the difficulty, the **greater the XP and prosperity rewards**.

---

## 🧠 Attributes and Stats

Tasks are linked to **attributes**, such as:

- 🧠 Intelligence (e.g., studying)
- 💪 Strength (e.g., working out)
- 🎯 Focus
- ❤️ Health
- 📈 Discipline

Completing tasks grants XP to related attributes. This creates a **real sense of personal growth**, with visible and measurable progress.

---

## 🗂 Visual Organization

- **Trello-style Kanban Board**: create lists, and cards to organize your tasks and projects.
- **Integrated Calendar**: view and schedule tasks on specific dates.
- **Monthly Goals**: for example, “run 50km this month.” Upon completion, you earn XP and prosperity in the relevant attributes.

---

## 🚀 Purpose

The system doesn’t replace personal effort—it transforms it into a **motivating and enjoyable experience**.

> **The more you commit, the more you grow—in the system and in real life.**
